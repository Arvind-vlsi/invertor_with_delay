# INVERTOR WITH DELAY 
  >In have designed invertor(only applied 2ns delay to pmos not to nmos) in which pmos gives correct output after the delay of 2ns, In the waveform red and blue part in Y (i.e output waveform) represents unknown value(i.e X) ,let take a case when a=1 , y give unknown value(i.e X for first 2ns after that it give y=0,because after 2ns pmos is available,and the gives y=0 till a=1, and when a=0 ,y gives unknown value for first 2ns because now nmos is not available, after that y is 1 till a=0;
